Green View Index calculcated for Chicago streets.

The Green View Index is generated by calculating the amount of vegetation in the view from google streetview from a given point. Much more information and the tools used to generate this data are available here: http://senseable.mit.edu/treepedia/

If you are using this data you should probably not include points from May and points with 0% GVI. May seems to be too early in the year and 0% was most likely a bad result from Google Streetview.

Thanks to Steven Vance for helping with this.

Projection is EPSG4326.
