Green View Index calculcated for about 60% of Chicago streets. Unfinished points are in unfinished/.

The Green View Index is generated by calculating the amount of vegetation in the view from google streetview from a given point. Much more information and the tools used to generate this data are available here: http://senseable.mit.edu/treepedia/

I've left in the points that generated an error during calculation they show a value of -166.66 but should not be included in any averaging. I don't have the bandwidth available to retry these points at this time.

If anyone wants to share an API key so I can complete this, it was getting too expensive to continue using Google's Street View API as a personal project and Google support was not helpful in allowing their apis to be used for nonprofit uses. Thanks to Steven Vance for donating some requests to help complete this effort.



Thanks,
Mike
